# Spring Boot Health Tourism Application

This document provides a step-by-step guide for developing a health tourism application using Spring Boot. The health tourism application aims to facilitate patients' travel to different countries or regions to receive healthcare services. This document explains how to develop the application by covering its basic requirements, project components, and important steps.

### 1. Project Creation and Basic Configuration

#### 1.1 Create a Spring Boot Project
Create a Spring Boot project by using Spring Initializr or Spring Boot CLI to set up the basic project configuration.

#### 1.2 Add Required Dependencies
Add dependencies such as Web, JPA (Java Persistence API), etc., to your project to fulfill the necessary requirements.

### 2. Database Modeling

#### 2.1 Entity Modeling
- Model basic entities such as health services, patients, doctors, hotels, flights, appointments, etc., using JPA.
- Define relationships between entities using JPA relationship annotations (e.g., patients assigned to doctors).

### 3. Creating RESTful APIs

#### 3.1 Create Controller Classes
- Create controller classes to define API endpoints that will perform essential functions (e.g., listing patients, listing doctors).

#### 3.2 Create Service Classes
- Develop service classes to separate business logic from the controllers.

#### 3.3 Database Operations
- Implement database operations using JPA within the service classes.

### 4. Security and Authorization

#### 4.1 Spring Security Integration
- Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security (utilizing JWT tokens).

#### 4.2 Define User Roles
- Define different user roles, such as Admin, Patient, and Doctor.

#### 4.3 Role-Based Access Control
- Create security configurations that control access permissions for specific roles.

### 5. Health Service and Doctor Assignment

#### 5.1 Implement Assignment Functionality
- Add functionality to assign patients to doctors.
- Create pages that allow patients to manage their appointments and health services.
- Doctors should be able to open a medical card and record examination notes based on appointments.

### 6. Travel Plan

#### 6.1 Generate a Travel Plan
- Prepare a travel plan based on appointments received from hospitals and doctors.
- Implement a mechanism to invalidate unconfirmed appointments and reservations within a specified time frame (e.g., 10 minutes).
